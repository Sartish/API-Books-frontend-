# Music toplist

A frontend application for my already created backend, with API created with Express in Node.js. The front-end is a multipage react application. Using React router for nagivation and material UI for coherent styling.

## The built and challanges 
After the API part was done, I did a frontend to show the results from the different endpoints.

The Home page shows all the 500 song in order, since that is too many result for one page, I decsided to make it more user-friendly and add pagination that has been added in packend with mongoose, and through the endpoint I could extract it in the frontend, showing a limited amount of results per page. I also had an endpoint for search artist or songs. I also have a page that shows all the songs that has been on the billbord, which was also dont through and endpoint in backend and manage to style the result with the help of matierl UI in frontend. 

This was also the first time using Material ui, which was one of the major challanges, since I wanted to informarate some regular css as well to make the page more dynamic and less stiff.
