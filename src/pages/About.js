            <p className={classes.article}>When I listen to these songs I reminisce to when I was younger. Sitting in the car with dad driving around with the radio on üé∂. When he heard a song, he recognises he started to sing along, with me daydreaming away in the back seat. Many of the songs got stuck in my head and when I hear them, I feel safe, a sense of melancholy happiness and inspiration.  I created this website to explore the curiosity of some of these old goodies. When where they released, who wrote the songs and what were the thoughts behind creating them?</p>
